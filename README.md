What are Events?
All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

Examples:

moving a mouse over an element
selecting a radio button
clicking on an element
The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".

Here are some common DOM events:

Mouse Events	Keyboard Events	        Form Events	        Document/Window Events
click	            keypress	            submit	            load
dblclick	        keydown	                change	            resize
mouseenter	        keyup	                focus	            scroll
